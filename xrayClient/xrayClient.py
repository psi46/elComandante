# @brief elComandante client for controlling an x-ray device
#
# @details
# This device receives commands from elComandante to operate and supervise
# and x-ray device. The commands are exchanged over the subsystem. The
# nature of the commands is very high level and they do not care about the
# details of the implementation and the type of x-ray device used. An
# example for a series of commands is: SET VOLTAGE 30, SET CURRENT 10,
# SET HV ON, SET BEAM ON. The xrayClient interprets these high level
# commands and, by knowing the specifics of the x-ray device, sends the
# appropriate commands to it. Additionally it checks whether the specified
# conditions are reached successfully and monitors them when nothing else
# is happening.
#
# To extend the x-ray client with more x-ray device implementations new classes
# have to be defined which inherit from the xray_generator.xray_generator and
# the motor_stage.motor_stage classes. Examples of such implementations are
# the id3003.id3003_xray_generator and the zaber.zaber_motor_stage classes.

# @details
# Since the xrayClient can use multiple different x-ray setups there is
# quite a number of command line arguments to chose how the client
# operates. Normally, the client is started by elComandante who reads
# the required arguments from its configuration files.
#
# Command line arguments:
# - \c \--xray-device	Xray generator device, e.g. /dev/ttyS0	(default: /dev/ttyF0)
# - \c \--xray-type	Xray generator device type, e.g. id3003	(default: id3003)
# - \c \--stage-device	Fluorescence device, e.g. /dev/ttyS0	(default: /dev/ttyF1)
# - \c \--stage-type	Fluorescence device type, e.g. zaber	(default: zaber)
# - \c \--directory	Directory for log files			(default: .)
# - \c \--timestamp	Timestamp for creation of file		(default: 0)
# - \c \--targets	Fluorescence target description		(default: "")

# Depending on the command line options a specific x-ray generator and motor stage

# and motor_stage.motor_stage). If this is guaranteed the specific nature of the device
# is entirely transparent to xrayClient (and elComandante).

# The state of the x-ray device which is set through this client is saved
# in internally. This is used to monitor the device. The reason for this is
# that at any time, due to physical interaction for example, the conditions
# of the device can change. In some devices there is a user interface that
# can be manipulated directly without computer (for changing voltages and
# currents for example). In all devices there is an interlock that turns
# off the high voltage or closes the shutter if the device is opened. When
# such an event happens, the xrayClient needs to know about it and this is
# the reason why the variables are monitored.
